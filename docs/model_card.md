# Model Card: Clinical-Trace AI

This is an educational, privacy-aware prototype using public and/or synthetic healthcare data. It is designed to demonstrate healthcare AI observability, not to provide medical advice or replace clinical judgment.

## Model Details

- Task: Predict 30-day readmission risk for diabetes hospital encounters.
- Model candidates: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost (small hyperparameter search).
- Selection metric: Highest validation F1 among thresholds with validation recall >= 0.65 (falls back to validation F2 if none qualify).
- Split: Patient-grouped (`patient_nbr`) train / validation / test via `GroupShuffleSplit`. Threshold and model chosen on validation; metrics reported on held-out test.
- Deployed model: XGBoost. Decision threshold ~0.30 (tuned on validation).
- Artifacts: `models/best_model.joblib`, `models/preprocessing_pipeline.joblib`, and `models/model_metadata.json`.

## Intended Use

This model is intended for portfolio demonstration of healthcare ML preprocessing, model training, explainability, API deployment, and observability patterns.

## Out-Of-Scope Use

Do not use this model for diagnosis, treatment decisions, medication decisions, real patient triage, operational allocation, or any clinical workflow.

## Training Data

The MVP uses the UCI Diabetes 130-US Hospitals dataset for years 1999-2008. The target maps `readmitted == "<30"` to the positive class and all other readmission labels to the negative class. Encounters ending in death or hospice discharge are removed because those patients cannot be readmitted.

## Performance

Training writes deployed metrics to `models/model_metadata.json`. Because the positive class is roughly 11%, positive-class recall, precision, F1, PR-AUC, and balanced accuracy should be read before accuracy.

Approximate held-out **test** performance for the current deployed model (exact values vary slightly per run):

| Metric | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Accuracy | ~0.597 |
| Balanced accuracy | ~0.628 |
| Recall (positive) | ~0.668 |
| Precision (positive) | ~0.170 |
| Specificity | ~0.588 |
| F1 (positive) | ~0.271 |
| F2 (positive) | ~0.421 |
| ROC-AUC | ~0.683 |
| PR-AUC (avg. precision) | ~0.240 |

These numbers are honest and deliberately not inflated. Ranking metrics (ROC-AUC / PR-AUC) sit near the documented ceiling (~0.65–0.68 ROC-AUC) for 30-day readmission on this dataset with these features. The current model adds leakage-safe longitudinal patient-history features (prior encounter / inpatient / emergency / readmission counts, running mean length of stay, first-encounter flag), computed from strictly earlier encounters ordered by `encounter_id` (a within-patient sequence proxy — no date columns exist, so no time-gap features are built). These produced the largest single ranking gain to date (ROC-AUC ~0.675 → ~0.683, PR-AUC ~0.236 → ~0.240); the validation-tuned threshold traded ~1.7 points of recall for higher specificity, leaving F1 flat. Earlier safe feature engineering (missingness indicators, train-only Top-N grouping of `payer_code`/`medical_specialty`, lab "measured" flags, comorbidity count), the leakage-free train/validation/test protocol (threshold tuned on validation, not test), and PR-AUC / balanced accuracy / specificity reporting remain in place. The recall floor of 0.65 intentionally caps achievable precision and F1.

### Leakage safety of longitudinal features

- Features use only encounters strictly earlier than the current row (per-patient `shift(1)`); a row's own values and its own `readmitted` label are never included in its `prior_*` counts.
- Because the split is by `patient_nbr`, all of a patient's encounters stay in the same partition, so within-patient history cannot cross the train/validation/test boundary.
- `encounter_id` is used only to order encounters within a patient and is never itself a model feature. `patient_nbr` is never a feature.
- Single-record inference has no history and safely defaults to first-encounter values (`is_first_encounter = 1`, all prior counts 0).
- Fidelity caveat: "prior" counts cover only this dataset's diabetic encounters (1999–2008) after deceased/hospice filtering, so they are lower bounds on true patient history.

## Limitations

- Not clinically validated.
- Historical 1999-2008 data may not reflect current practice.
- Class imbalance is substantial.
- Multiple encounters per patient require careful grouped splitting.
- Dataset collection and coding practices may embed demographic and institutional bias.

## Ethical Considerations

Outputs must be treated as model behavior demonstrations, not clinical evidence. Explanations must attribute observations to the model's analysis and include: "This is decision-support only and not medical advice."
