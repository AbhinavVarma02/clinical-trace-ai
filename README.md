# Clinical-Trace AI

Healthcare readmission risk platform with MLOps and LLMOps observability.

This is an educational, privacy-aware prototype using public and/or synthetic healthcare data. It is designed to demonstrate healthcare AI observability, not to provide medical advice or replace clinical judgment.

Every prediction and explanation is decision-support only. The platform is not a real clinical decision system, medical device, diagnostic tool, or substitute for professional judgment.

## Features

- Public UCI Diabetes 130-US Hospitals dataset preprocessing.
- Patient-level `GroupShuffleSplit` train/validation/test split to avoid leakage across encounters.
- Simple engineered features (prior utilization, emergency ratio, care intensity, long-stay and high-medication flags) and pruning of near-constant medication columns.
- Safe categorical handling: missingness indicators (`weight`, `payer_code`, `medical_specialty`), train-only Top-N grouping of `payer_code`/`medical_specialty` (+ Other + Missing), lab "measured" flags, and a diagnosis comorbidity count.
- Leakage-safe longitudinal patient-history features (prior encounter / inpatient / emergency / readmission counts, running mean length of stay, first-encounter flag) built from strictly earlier encounters ordered by `encounter_id` (sequence proxy only — no date/time-gap features exist).
- Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost training tracked with MLflow.
- F1-maximizing model selection with a recall floor, tuned on validation and reported on held-out test.
- SHAP-style top feature explanations for prediction outputs.
- FastAPI endpoints for health, model info, prediction, explanation, and feedback.
- Offline demo mode with rule-based explanations and no API keys.
- Optional LangChain and LangSmith LLM explanation path.
- Streamlit dashboard for predictions, explanations, metrics, and trace status.
- Security checks for ignored `.env` files and common secret patterns.

`src/database.py`, `src/monitoring.py`, `src/rag_pipeline.py`, and
`monitoring/drift_report.py` are intentional one-line placeholders that mark
post-MVP scope; they are documented as out of scope, not dead code.

## Quick Start

Step 1: Install dependencies

```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Step 2: Run `python src/train.py` (generates model artifacts locally)

```bash
python src/train.py
```

If `data/raw/diabetic_data.csv` is missing, training attempts to download the public UCI zip file and extract `diabetic_data.csv` and `IDS_mapping.csv` into `data/raw/`.

Step 3a: Run locally (uvicorn + streamlit)

```bash
uvicorn api.main:app --reload --port 8000
streamlit run dashboard/app.py --server.port 8501
```

Step 3b: Or build Docker after step 2 (docker build, docker run)

```bash
docker build -t clinical-trace-ai .
docker run -p 8000:8000 clinical-trace-ai
```

## Offline Demo Mode

No API keys are required for training, `/predict`, `/explain`, or the Streamlit dashboard. Without `OPENAI_API_KEY`, explanations use the rule-based fallback and include the required disclaimer:

```text
This is decision-support only and not medical advice.
```


## Streamlit Dashboard

Run the product dashboard with:

```bash
streamlit run dashboard/app.py --server.port 8501
```

The dashboard works in offline demo mode without OpenAI or LangSmith keys and uses rule-based explanations when the LLM layer is not configured.

## Model Performance

After training, metrics for the deployed model are written to `models/model_metadata.json`. The training script logs accuracy, balanced accuracy, positive-class precision, recall, specificity, F1, F2, ROC-AUC, PR-AUC (average precision), confusion matrix, and feature importance artifacts to local MLflow runs. Both validation and held-out test metrics are logged for each candidate model.

**Evaluation protocol (honest, no leakage)**: Patients are split by `patient_nbr` into train / validation / test partitions. Each candidate is trained on train, its decision threshold is tuned on validation, and it is finally scored on the untouched test set. The threshold and the model are chosen using validation only, so the reported test metrics are not tuned against the test set.

**Model selection**: The best model/threshold is chosen by maximizing validation F1 among thresholds where validation recall >= 0.65. If no candidate meets the recall floor, the model with the highest validation F2 is selected instead.

**Metrics snapshot (held-out test)**: The current deployed XGBoost model — selected under the rules above — scores approximately:

| Metric | Original* | Val-tuned split | + Safe features | + Longitudinal (current) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Accuracy | 0.551 | ~0.580 | ~0.588 | ~0.597 |
| Balanced accuracy | (not tracked) | ~0.625 | ~0.630 | ~0.628 |
| Recall (positive) | 0.704 | ~0.683 | ~0.685 | ~0.668 |
| Precision (positive) | 0.159 | ~0.166 | ~0.169 | ~0.170 |
| Specificity | (not tracked) | ~0.567 | ~0.575 | ~0.588 |
| F1 (positive) | 0.260 | ~0.267 | ~0.271 | ~0.271 |
| F2 (positive) | 0.418 | ~0.420 | ~0.425 | ~0.421 |
| ROC-AUC | 0.671 | ~0.670 | ~0.675 | ~0.683 |
| PR-AUC (avg. precision) | (not tracked) | ~0.234 | ~0.236 | ~0.240 |
| Threshold | 0.45 | ~0.30 | ~0.30 | ~0.30 (tuned on validation) |

\* Original numbers came from a two-way split where the threshold was tuned directly on the test set. The other columns use a true held-out test set with the threshold tuned on validation. Exact values vary slightly per run.

**Honest interpretation**: 30-day readmission is a rare event (~11% positive rate) and this dataset has a well-documented ROC-AUC ceiling around 0.65–0.68 with these features. The leakage-safe longitudinal patient-history features produced the largest single ranking gain so far — ROC-AUC ~0.675 → ~0.683 and PR-AUC ~0.236 → ~0.240 — with precision essentially flat-to-slightly-up and F1 unchanged; the validation-tuned threshold traded ~1.7 points of recall (still ~0.67, above the 0.65 floor) for higher specificity. The improvement is concentrated in *ranking* (ROC-AUC / PR-AUC), which is the honest signal of a better model; the thresholded F1 is capped by the recall floor and did not move. Gains are real but modest and are not overstated.

**XGBoost tuning**: Training runs a small practical search over XGBoost configurations varying `n_estimators`, `max_depth`, `learning_rate`, `subsample`, `colsample_bytree`, `min_child_weight`, `reg_lambda`, `reg_alpha`, and a `scale_pos_weight` multiplier that trades recall for precision.

## SHAP Example

Prediction responses include top contributing features. The API sends only synthetic patient ID, risk label, risk probability, model version, and top feature names to the optional LLM explanation layer.

## LangSmith Tracing

Set `LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2=true`, `LANGCHAIN_API_KEY`, and `LANGCHAIN_PROJECT=clinical-trace-ai` to enable LangSmith tracing. Traces include only safe metadata: request ID, synthetic patient ID, model version, risk score, risk label, prompt version, top feature names, and safety flags.

## Testing

Run the full test suite (offline, no API keys or network required):

```bash
pytest tests/ -v
```

The suite covers the API routes, preprocessing and leakage-safe patient splits,
model training on small synthetic fixtures, the rule-based fallback, LLM safety
validation, and the secret / `.env` security guardrails. No external LLM is
called during tests.

## Security And Privacy Notes

- Never commit a real `.env` file.
- `data/raw/`, `data/processed/`, `models/`, and MLflow artifacts are generated locally and ignored.
- Raw patient records are not sent to LLM providers.
- The LLM prompt forbids diagnoses, prescribing, guaranteed outcomes, and uncited claims about clinical literature.
- Patient IDs used by the API should be synthetic, for example `synthetic_001`.

## What Is Not Committed

To keep the repository clean and safe, the following are generated locally or
private and are intentionally excluded via `.gitignore`:

- `.env` — real API keys (copy from `.env.example` and fill in your own).
- `data/raw/` and `data/processed/` — the UCI dataset and derived splits,
  downloaded/generated by `python src/train.py`.
- `models/*.joblib` and `models/*.json` — trained model and pipeline artifacts.
- `mlruns/` and `mlartifacts/` — local MLflow tracking runs and artifacts.
- `.pytest_cache/`, `.pytest_run_tmp/`, `__pycache__/` — test and bytecode caches.

`.env.example`, the model/data cards under `docs/`, and `models/.gitkeep` are
committed so the project stays reproducible.

## Known Limitations

- The UCI dataset covers 1999-2008 hospital encounters and is not representative of current clinical practice.
- The model is not clinically validated.
- Class imbalance makes accuracy insufficient; model selection balances F1 and recall on validation, and PR-AUC / balanced accuracy are reported alongside accuracy.
- ROC-AUC / PR-AUC are near the known ceiling for this dataset and these features; reported gains are modest and are not overstated.
- Demographic and site-level biases may exist in the public source data.
- MVP monitoring is limited to local artifacts and optional traces.
